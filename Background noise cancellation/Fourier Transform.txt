[DataIn, Fs] = audioread('Published/highfrequencynoise.wav');
%Read an audio file sampled data into DataIn and the sample rate into Fs in
%Hz. [DataIn, Fs] are now output arguments.

[N,P] = size(DataIn);
% size(DataIn) determines how many samples the audio file has. N is the
% sample size and P is the number of audio channels. P will no longer be
% utilized past this point.

ts = 1/Fs; % ts is sampling period
tmax = (N-1)*ts; %max is the maximum period
t =0:ts:tmax;
%Defines a vector t that starts at 0 and increments by the sampling
%period and goesto maximum period

plot(t,DataIn) % Plot the audio file
f = -Fs/2:Fs/(N-1):Fs/2; % For plotting the frequency spectrum
z = fftshift(fft(DataIn)); % applies the fourier transform to the audio file

plot(f,abs(z)) % plots the result of the fourier transform

ylabel('Power'); %lable the y axis
